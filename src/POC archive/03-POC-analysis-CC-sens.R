#NOTES
# What is the proper weighting of the regression functions?
# What is the proper WASH-less asset index to use?
# Is roof/floor/wall material and number of rooms already in the wealth index?
  
#Need to move BH to main folders
#need to check all cleaned surveys are mics6 and there are no MICS5
#Need to see if bh.sav is available online for downloaded surveys missing it

#BH datasets are much longer than other datasets... 
#need to check if longitudinal and I'm merging correctly. I'm just using birth order

#left_joining bh is increasing dataset size
#NOTE: need to look up line number and double check that I am merging datasets correctly
